  model interacts with the database. gets and sends data and runs database logic
  view is responsible for showing the end user content
  controller gets requests from view it sends to model and gets appropriate response from model and sends to view

/users/new    method="GET"     # :controller => 'users', :action => 'new'

/users/       method="POST"    # :controller => 'users', :action => 'create'

/users/1/edit method="GET"     # :controller => 'users', :action => 'edit'

/users/1      method="PUT"     # :controller => 'users', :action => 'update'

/users/1      method="DELETE"  # :controller => 'users', :action => 'destroy'



3b. Which of the above routes must always be passed params and why?

probably update because it needs a param to update to and from

4. What is the public folder used for in Rails?

  Your answer:for when we want to post stuff to the public for them to access

  "/game:guess"=> "main#game"


6. In an html form, what does the "action" attribute tell you about the form? How do you designate the HTTP verb for the form?

  Your answer:C(create)R(read)U(update)D(delete) match GET POST PATCH PUT DELETE

  <%=form_tag action: "/main/game", method: :get do %>
  <% end %>

 The action attribute is used to inform the browser what page to call once the "submit" button is pressed.
 the http verbs are used when you want a certain action to happen , like DELETE/destroy
